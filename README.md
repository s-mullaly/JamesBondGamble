# James Bond Betting Strategies

This project was completed during a course on simulations as part of the Georgia Tech MS Analytics program. 

The notebook used for this project along with the report are included in this repository.

James Bond, 007, is a secret agent for the British Secret Service.
In his many adventures in novels and film James Bond often finds himself at a casino table.
While sipping martinis (shaken, not stirred of course) James Bond has become an accomplished gambler playing Roulette, Black Jack, Craps, Poker and Bacarat.
The goal of this project is to look at the strategies that have been described in the books, or the best we can determine from the films for Roulette and Black Jack. Does James Bond know how to beat the house or is he just as likely to lose as the rest of us? And for fun we will also look at the Black Jack strategy of another 'International Man of Mystery' to see how he would do compared to Mr. Bond.
It seems fitting to apply some Monte Carlo simulations to these games to find out more.
